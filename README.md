# ðŸ‘‹ Gravity Fighters Introduction

### What Is Gravity Fighters?

Gravity Fighters is a play-to-earn Metaverse game incorporating NFTs, DeFi, and GameFi, to enable players and participants to earn rewards by playing the game.

The Gravity Fighters platform consists of a series of AI-generated NFTs along with a BEP-20 token $GVT that powers the platform and its ecosystem.

Gravity Fighters follows the steps of projects like Ailen Worlds with a twist to enable users to engage in PVP battles and added mechanics to enable players to upgrade their NFTs and earn tokens in a myriad of ways.

The token behind the platform will enable users to mint NFTs, purchase upgrades for their NFTs, interact with the Gravity Fighters ecosystem, and much more.

$GVT holders will also have an opportunity to participate in the Gravity Fighters' DAO governance system that will shape the future of the project.

Gravity Fighters' mission is to empower players to start earning a significant income in the Metaverse, utilizing skill and strategy to build their army of fighters and claim their spot on the leaderboards.
