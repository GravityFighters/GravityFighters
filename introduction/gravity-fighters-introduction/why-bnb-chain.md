# Why BNB Chain?

BNB is currently the most feasible blockchain for dApps requiring a high amount of transactions and interactions. BNB chain features low-cost transactions unlike its counterpart Ethereum.

In addition, BNB's dual chain architecture makes it easy to deploy both tokens and NFTs on the same blockchain.

BNB's EVM compatibility makes it the perfect choice to develop a robust NFT-based Metaverse gaming platform that can continue to expand in 2022 and beyond. BNB has some of the best support and documentation since the same concepts from ETH carry over to this blockchain.

In addition, BNB is one of the most battle-tested blockchains which gives it some of the best security on the market. BNB is the perfect choice for Gravity Fighters which encourages user interaction and high-activity dApp development.
