# Abstract

Cryptocurrencies are always evolving and blockchain technology opened a host of opportunities for users and developers to build next-generation dApps that empower their users through ownership of assets.

Decentralized tech is borderless and provides an equal playing field for consumers worldwide.

The latest evolution of blockchain tech involves the gamification of assets in the form of NFTs. Metaverse and NFTs are a match made in heaven and the resulting synergy gave birth to a new niche in crypto called Metaverse gaming.

The video game industry has long been plagued by centralized companies that continue to mistreat their players by chasing profits. Blockchain-based Metaverse gaming gives power back to the consumers through decentralized ownership of assets.

The future of gaming will be built on the blockchain as consumers realize the host of benefits that come with full ownership of in-game assets. In addition, blockchain technology makes cheating obsolete as all in-game activities happen on the blockchain and can be easily verified by any entity.

That's why Gravity Fighters decided to launch its Metaverse NFT-based game utilizing the latest blockchain tech and the most robust blockchain to bring its vision to life.

By default, Gravity Fighters provides full ownership of assets to players, with no way for anyone to take your assets away from you or lock you out of the platform.

By design, Gravity Fighters is cheating-proof, and the unique game mechanics make it easy to learn but hard to master. In addition, through its DAO, Gravity Fighters will follow the community's lead to shaping the future of the project.

Gravity Fighters is planning to revolutionize Metaverse gaming by perfecting the basic concepts first, before moving on to creating a robust Metaverse.
