# ðŸŽ® Game Modes

Gravity Fighters is designed so that players have several options to choose from when it comes to earning $GVT tokens with their Gravity Fighters NFTs.

* Daily Quests
* Planet Mining
* PVP Battles

### Daily Quests

Every day, Gravity Fighters will issue a quest for users to do. It can range from mining a certain amount of times, playing a certain amount of PVP matches, etc.

When the player completes a quest, he will be rewarded with extra experience which can speed up the process of leveling up their Gravity Fighter NFTs which will net more rewards.

### Planet Mining

The default mode for most players will be to start off mining GVT tokens on a planet. This will be the main aspect of the game where players will be able to slowly level up their Gravity Fighter NFTs and earn rewards while doing so.

### PVP Battles

Once players have assembled their team of Gravity Fighters they can send them to battles to test their skills against other players. Players will receive experience for battling other players, but they can only battle players once every 24 hours.&#x20;

It's always a good idea to send your NFTs to battle especially if you're done mining for the day.
