# ðŸ’¥ Gravity Fighters

### Overview

Gravity Fighters' Metaverse consists of several planets, each featuring unique stats which benefit various Fighters. Depending on the type of skills and attributes a player's Fighter possesses it may be more beneficial to assign the Fighter to a specific planet.

After assigning a Gravity Fighter to a specific planet, users will then be able to start mining $GVT tokens. Users can reassign their Fighters to various planets but the mining timer will reset as a result.

Each Fighter will be able to equip three NFT tools to boost their mining power. Players will be able to purchase NFT tools from our official marketplace when it launches. By default, users receive three basic tools and can start mining GVT tokens right away.

Each time a user mines tokens with his Gravity Fighter NFT, they will gain experience which will level up the NFT. The higher level an NFT is the more power it has and the most tokens it can mine. In addition, the higher level an NFT is, the more valuable it is.

### Properties

Each Gravity Fighter NFT has 5 stats:

* ATT (Attack/Mining Power)
* STR (Strenght)
* DEX (Dexterity)
* INT (Intellect)
* DMGX (Damage Multiplier)

**STR**, **DEX**, **INT**, and **DMGX** are generated randomly and each has a minimum and a maximum value. The ATT is calculated using the below formula:

ATT = (STR(min)+STR(max) + DEX(min)+DEX(maX) + INT(min)+INT(max)) \* ((DMGX(min) + DMGX(max))/2)

### Experience

Each time a user mines a planet with their Gravity Fighter, they gain anywhere between 10-20 experience. Each gravity fighter also has 60 max levels, each level adds more stats to the STR, DEX, and INT values. The DMGX value stays the same regardless of the level of the NFT.

Each level requires more experience to level up, here's the breakdown of the experience required to level up an NFT

* LVL 1-10: 100EXP
* LVL 11-20: 200EXP
* LVL 21-30: 400EXP
* LVL 31-40: 800EXP
* LVL 41-50: 1600EXP
* LVL 51-60: 3200EXP
